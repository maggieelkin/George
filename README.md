# George


George.py is a genetic algorithm. The goal is to evolve a string that is equivalent to the target. 

George is named after the infinite monkey theorem. 

Background on genetic algorithms and the infitie monkey theorem can be found [here](Examples/Genetic_Algorithms_Explained.pdf).

The major source of inspiration was from [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-9-the-evolution-of-code/).

The [example](Examples/George_Example.pdf) first derives a short string, "to be or not to be" then derives the full text from Shakespeare's Sonnet I.
